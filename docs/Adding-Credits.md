# Adding Custom Credits
To add custom credits, you have to go to `mods/<your-mod>/data/` and add a text file called `credits.txt`.

Then, copy and paste this code:
```
Heading
Person::Contribution::Link
```

## Example
An example to see how it actually works:
```
Section 1
John Doe::He did the thing.::https://www.google.com/
Jane Doe::She did something too.::https://www.anywhere.com/

Section 2
Other Guy::i forgor::https://youtu.be/
```
